## Why it has unused "multiplayed" related scripts?
Because I want to make this game online, but I gave up. I realized that I need more study about them, but some of the script can be useful for later use.
That's because I remained unusing network related resources.


## Control
- WASD: Basic movements
- R: Reloading
- M1/Ctrl: Fire
- M2: Aiming
- L-Shift: Sprinting


ve. It has 30 round magazine, and easily kill the zombie with 2-3 headshot. But it has huge firing recoil, so you should buy some reduce recoil upgrades.
- MP5K(Compakt PDW) is most cheapest primary weapon. It has 25 magazine and has very high fire rate, but also has weakness damage in this game. It has cheap ammo cost and upgrade cost, but I'm not recommend to use this weapon for a long time.
- Police 9mm Pistol(Glock) is starting weapon and it's only one secondary weapon. It means any weapon you buy, you still can use pistol. Pistol has cheapest ammo price and upgrade cost.


## Bugs & Improvements
Please write the issue on the github page when you found bugs. But I have no plan to improve this game, because this game is just for demonstration.
